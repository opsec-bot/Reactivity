### COM-port map (Phase 1, OTG board — 2026-06-05)

| Port | Device | VID:PID | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| COM12 | Silicon Labs CP210x USB-UART bridge | 10C4:EA60 | ESP32-S3-USB-OTG micro-USB port — upload + serial |
| COM13 | Espressif native USB CDC | 303A:1001 | OTG board USB_DEV edge connector |
| COM1 | Motherboard serial | — | ignore |

### COM-port map (Phase 2, DevKitC host — 2026-06-07)

OTG board **retired** (Phase 1 reverse-engineering done). Host is now the
**ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1-N32R16V** — its free headers let us attach the UART link to
the Pico without soldering (the OTG board's GPIO47/48 are bare pads). See
`docs/esp32-s3-n32r16v.md` for the full board reference + verified build flags.

| Port | Device | VID:PID | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| **COM7** | Silicon Labs CP210x (CP2102) | 10C4:EA60 | **DevKitC `UART` port — upload + serial console** |
| **COM14→COM15** | Pico H — USB HID mouse + CDC | 239A:CAFE → **046D:C547** | After Phase 4 the Pico wears the "Logitech USB Receiver" identity, so Windows assigned a **new COM** (was COM14, now COM15). The app auto-detects both IDs. |
| COM1 | Motherboard serial | — | ignore |

> A `303A:1001` (Espressif native USB) may also appear — that's an ESP-side port,
> not our Pico; ignore it for the app.

> Both 10C4:EA60 boards share the same VID:PID; they're distinguished only by USB
> serial number. The DevKitC's native `USB` port (303A:1001) is left **unplugged**
> so GPIO19/20 are free for the dongle.

## Compile / upload (ESP32 host, Phase 1)

> NOTE: the dedicated `esp32s3usbotg` board variant **presets** flash size (8MB),
> PSRAM (off), etc. — so the `FlashSize`/`PSRAM`/`CDCOnBoot` options from HANDOFF
> §5 are INVALID on this FQBN (they only apply to the generic "ESP32S3 Dev
> Module"). The only knob is `USBMode`.
>
> **Use `USBMode=default`, NOT `hwcdc`.** On this board the menu bundles flags:
>   - `USBMode=hwcdc`   -> usb_mode=1, **cdc_on_boot=1** -> `Serial` = native USB
>     CDC. We reroute native USB to the host port (GPIO18 HIGH), so that CDC is
>     physically on the host connector and INVISIBLE to the PC. Result: no serial.
>   - `USBMode=default` -> usb_mode=0, **cdc_on_boot=0** -> `Serial` = UART0 ->
>     CP210x bridge -> COM12. ✓ And the OTG controller stays free for EspUsbHost
>     to claim as host. THIS is what we want.
> (HANDOFF §5's "Hardware CDC and JTAG" advice was for the generic Dev Module and
> backfires here. Verified against esp32 core 3.0.0 boards.txt.)

```powershell
# Compile
arduino-cli compile `
  --fqbn "esp32:esp32:esp32s3usbotg:USBMode=default" `
  ".\firmware\esp32_host"

# Upload (serial/UART mode, via the CP210x bridge on COM12)
arduino-cli upload -p COM12 `
  --fqbn "esp32:esp32:esp32s3usbotg:USBMode=default" `
  ".\firmware\esp32_host"
```

Side effect (harmless, even useful): opening COM12 asserts DTR/RTS, which
auto-resets the ESP32. So every capture start reboots the board -> the dongle
re-enumerates -> the descriptor dump reprints. Good for grabbing descriptors.

## Capture serial

```powershell
python .\scripts\capture_serial.py COM12 .\captures\dongle-descriptors.log
```

`Serial` on this firmware = UART0 -> CP210x -> COM12 (NOT the native USB port).

## Observations

- 2026-06-05: First capture attempt with `USBMode=hwcdc` produced only ROM boot
  text + `E USBH: Device 1 gone` on COM12 — no banner, no reports. Cause: Serial
  was on native USB CDC (rerouted to host port). Fixed by `USBMode=default`.
- The Arduino IDE's `serial-monitor` helper held COM12 (`Access is denied`),
  blocking uploads. Closing the IDE freed it. We're CLI-only now.
- Phase 1 decode results live in `PROGRESS.md`. Short version:
  **046D:C547**, mouse on EP 0x81, 13-byte report, no report ID,
  `[btn8][btn8][dxLE16][dyLE16][wheel8][hwheel8][vendor×5]`.
- Decoded sanity check: L/R/M/back/fwd all map to bits 0–4 of byte 0; wheel
  up=+1, down=−1; dx/dy signed and direction-correct. Max flick seen ±53
  (16-bit width confirmed by descriptor, not by clipping).
