Hardware Reference[](#hardware-reference "Permalink to this heading")
----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Block Diagram[](#block-diagram "Permalink to this heading")

The block diagram below shows the components of ESP32-S3-USB-OTG and their interconnections.

[![ESP32-S3-USB-OTG](../_images/sch_function_block.png)](../_images/sch_function_block.png)

ESP32-S3-USB-OTG Block Diagram (click to enlarge)[](#id9 "Permalink to this image")

Please note that the external interface corresponding to the `USB_HOST D+ D-` signal in the functional block diagram is `USB DEV`, which means that ESP32-S3 is used as a device to receive signals from other USB hosts. The external interface corresponding to the `USB_DEV D+ D-` signal is `USB HOST`, which means that ESP32-S3 acts as a host to control other devices.

### Power Supply Options[](#power-supply-options "Permalink to this heading")

There are three power supply methods for the development board:

1.  Power supply through the `Micro_USB` interface
    
    *   Use the USB cable (standard A to Micro-B) to connect the motherboard to a power supply device, and set battery switch to OFF. Please note that in this power supply mode, only the motherboard and display are powered.
        
2.  Power supply through the `USB_DEV` interface
    
    *   Set `DEV_VBUS_EN` to high level, and set the battery switch to OFF. This mode can supply power to the `USB HOST` interface. The lithium battery will be charged at the same time (if the lithium battery is installed)
        
3.  Power supply through the battery
    
    *   Set `BOOST_EN` to high level, and set the battery switch to ON. You should solder a 1-Serial lithium battery (3.7 V ~ 4.2 V) to the power solder joint reserved on the back of the motherboard first. This mode can supply power to the `USB HOST` interface at the same time. The battery interface description is as follows:

Battery Connection (click to enlarge)[](#id10 "Permalink to this image")

### USB HOST Interface Power Options[](#usb-host-interface-power-options "Permalink to this heading")

The `USB HOST` interface (Type-A female port) can supply power to the connected USB device. The power supply voltage is 5 V and the maximum current is 500 mA.

*   There are two power supply methods for the `USB HOST` interface:
    
    1.  Power is supplied through the `USB_DEV` interface, and the 5 V power is directly from the power source connected to the interface.
        
    2.  Power is supplied through the lithium battery, and the 3.6 V ~ 4.2 V voltage of the lithium battery is boosted to 5 V through the Boost circuit. The working status of Boost IC can be controlled by BOOST\_EN/GPIO13, set high to enable Boost.

*   500 mA current limiting circuit:
    
    1.  The current limiting IC MIC2005A can limit the maximum output current of the `USB HOST` interface to 500 mA. Please set the `IDEV_LIMIT_EN` (GPIO17) to high level to enable the current-limiting IC to output voltage.

*   When **USB\_SEL** (GPIO18) is set to high level, the USB D+/D- Pin (GPIO19, 20) will be connected to `USB_DEV D+ D-`. Then you can use the `USB HOST` interface (Type-A female Port) to connect other USB devices.
    
*   When **USB\_SEL** (GPIO18) is set to low level, the USB D+/D- Pin (GPIO19, 20) will be connected to `USB_HOST D+ D-`. Then you can use the `USB DEV` interface (Type-A male port) to connect to a host like a PC.
    
*   **USB\_SEL** is pulled low level by default.
